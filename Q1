Our Sales Team constantly adds new channels, where we can sell our vidaXL products. From
operational point of view, adding a new channel can often take some time so doesn’t always have a
connection to fetch sales data automatically set up right away. In such cases, in order to get the data,
we need to get an export file from the channel’s backend, after which we need to convert the export file
to our internal template.
To speed up this process we need to have a query working to do this conversion.
Data set file (‘Orders BONPRIX.xlsx’) contains a list of new orders that was exported from our new
French partner. It contains the following information:
• Order number and order date
• Product number (SKU) and quantity ordered
• Order price
• Customer name and address data
Question
Based on this data table, create and present an SQL query that will return, per order date:
• Number of orders
• Number of items bought
• Total turnover
Note: You are allowed to use any SQL syntax. Currently we are using Google Big Query (GBQ) as our
data warehouse. Thus using GBQ syntax can be considered a plus.


We will use batch import
CreateProject project-401316
We will create dataset, name it key1212
Select FR region
We proceed to CREATE TABLE and select Upload under the Source section
Name the table: bonprix_fr
SELECT OUTDETECT SCHEMA
Advance Options - Select Header information and write 1 where header ignore info is 0

SELECT 
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP (%Y-%m-%d, TIMESTAMP (Date_created), "UTC") as Order_date,
Count (distinct Order_number) as total_orders,
sum (Quantity) as total_quantity,
FROM `project-401316.key1212.bonprix_fr`
group by 1
