From our main warehouse located in Venlo, the Netherlands, we send orders to customers in 27 different
European countries on a daily basis. These customers can order products on any of our online platforms
that are available in their specific country (company webshops, eBay, Amazon, and many others).
Naturally, we need to deliver each order as fast as possible, and at least within the delivery time that is
displayed on our platform. The actual delivery time depends on different factors, which can be both
internal (order processing time) and external processes (payment time and shipping time). The Logistics
department needs to handle customer orders as efficiently as possible, and therefore needs to make a
daily workload planning. Furthermore, it is important to know how long each process takes, and where
we have opportunities to optimise processing times. The dataset file ‘Order data.xlsx’ contains daily
order data for the weeks 20-29 of 2017, of some of our main European markets:
• Order ID and shipping country
• Product code (SKU) and quantity ordered
• Number of the shipment (internal Logistics number)
• Payment date/time, order creation date/time, ‘order processed’ date/time (when ready for
shipment), and delivery time (delivered to the customer)
