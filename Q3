In order to understand how created orders/ processed orders and delivered orders vary on a week day, we complete our
initial queries like this and proceeded to create the same tables, and unions.

Select OrderId, Shipping_country,
extract(week from Order_creation_date ) as week_order,
FORMAT_DATE("%A" , Order_creation_date ) as day_order,
count (distinct OrderID) as total_orders,
count (distinct Shipment_carton_number) as total_cartons,
FROM `vidaxl-401316.key1213.orderdata_new`
group by OrderID, Shipping_country, Order_creation_date
Saved results as OC_weekday

Select OrderId, Shipping_country,
extract(week from Order_processed_date ) as week_order,
FORMAT_DATE("%A" , Order_processed_date ) as day_order,
count (distinct OrderID) as total_orders,
count (distinct Shipment_carton_number) as total_cartons,
FROM `vidaxl-401316.key1213.orderdata_new`
group by OrderID, Shipping_country, Order_processed_date
Saved results as OP_weekday

Select OrderId, Shipping_country,
extract(week from Delivery_time ) as week_order,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%A", TIMESTAMP (Delivery_time), "UTC") as day_order,
count (distinct OrderID) as total_orders,
count (distinct Shipment_carton_number) as total_cartons,
FROM `vidaxl-401316.key1213.orderdata_new`
group by OrderID, Shipping_country, Delivery_time
Saved results as OD_weekday

SELECT *,
FROM `project-401316.key1213.OC_weekday`
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `project-401316.key1213.OP_weekday`
UNION ALL
SELECT *,
FROM `project-401316.key1213.OD_weekday`


Saved results as BigQuery table O_CPD_weekday
After pivoting we get this distribution of orders and cartoons.
