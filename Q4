For each shipping country, which stage of the delivery (order creation, order processing or shipment) is
taking the longest time? Can you think of any way to improve our efficiency in this stage?

Saved table, opened CSV in Google Sheets and pivoted.


The results show us that Germany has a big latency from order creation to order delivery. Since the process if
Order Created < Order Processed < Ordered Delivered / Paid it’s only normal that this latency propagates at other
stages ( processed / payment).

CH & FR seem to have a big delay between the days the order has been created up to the days the order has been
processed.

Given this table, it is safe to say that all countries process payments within a day from order creation.
Since DE is the biggest market in the dataset provided, I would investigate the frequency with which delays occur for all
orders, and is it an issue stemmed from different infrastructure communications and not a real issue. Sometimes, in a
warehouse we could use different technologies for different scopes, and their APIs might have different time zones,
which could influence the reporting of latency. If we exclude this option, we would have to discuss directly with the
employees in the warehouse and understand what are some of the major dealbreakers in the way their work processes
are currently set up. We should try to experiment and see what modifications to this current setup brings the most
efficiency, for workers and the company. Also, taking information direct from warehouse floor, will help us better design
solutions to problems that might already occur, can help us prevent future problems, and helps us keep employees
motivated and happy, which in itself it’s an important factor for overall company productivity.
